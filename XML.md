### XML self check:

```A well-formed XML document follows these rules (most of which we’ve already discussed):

1. An XML document must contain a single root element that contains all other elements.
2. All elements must be properly nested.
3. All elements must be closed either with a closing tag or with a “self-closing” empty-element tag (i.e. <tag/>).
4. All attribute values must be quoted.
